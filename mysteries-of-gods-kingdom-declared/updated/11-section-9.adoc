== Section IX.

[.chapter-subtitle--blurb]
To whom the Spirit bears witness and seals both an assurance
of the Father`'s love and true justification with God.

None have the witness of God`'s Spirit bearing witness to them and in them,
who have not believed in Christ "`the true Light that
enlightens every man that comes into the world.`"^
footnote:[1 John 1:9]
By Him alone is life begotten, by His powerful operation in those who believe in Him.
He is eternal life itself, and His word is Spirit and life,
by which the new creature is framed and formed in those who believe.
Unto these He makes manifest His power,
for it is unto Him (who is the life of men) that
all power in heaven and earth is committed.
Nothing was made or created but by Him,
nor is any man turned from sin but by Him and by His mighty power.
Without Him is death; in Him is life, and the life is the light of men.

Now, none but those that are born of the light,
and are begotten by Him who is light,
can have the Spirit of Christ (who is light) bear witness unto them,
nor can they have the assurance of the Father`'s love.
For only those who are born of the Spirit, and walk after the Spirit,
are justified by the Spirit of the Lord.
The assurance of God`'s love is not made manifest to His enemies,
but unto them that are born and brought forth in His own image,
in His own likeness and nature, which is pure and incorruptible,
without stain or defilement.
These are born of the holy Seed which is the heir of the promise,
and they know the living hope which purifies the heart,
and brings the answer of a good conscience unto those
that feel and witness the washing of regeneration.
These have known in themselves the clean water poured
forth upon them which has taken away stains,
spots, blemishes, and defilements.
For wherever these stains and defilements have not been washed out,
and the heart cleansed from them,
and where this washing is not believed in (nor God`'s all-sufficiency felt,
and His power made manifest),
there cannot be true assurance of the Father`'s love in the heart,
nor the Spirit`'s witness and assurance of justification.
For where sin remains unsubdued and not taken away,
the Spirit of the Father there condemns the sin,
together with the one who has joined to it and become one with it.
For no sin is brought forth except where there is a consenting
and assenting to the instigation of the devil.
When a temptation arises, whether within or without,
there can be a resisting and striving against it for a little while.
However, if the heart is not kept close to the Spirit,
the enemy will at last find entrance,
and so captivate the understanding that there is
an agreement and a joining to the adversary.
Thus the Spirit pronounces the sentence of condemnation upon
the one who has joined himself to the harlot (becoming one
flesh with her) and who is not joined to Christ the Seed.
For whatever has joined and consented to drink the cup of fornication,
must also drink of the cup of indignation and terror,
and bear the stroke of divine justice,
and lie in patience under it until that is cut down which has joined to deceit.
Only then is there remission of transgression,
and the creature is then justified in the sight of God.
For sin is not blotted out of the book of God`'s
remembrance until it be turned from and repented of;
nor until then does the creature stand clear in the sight of God when He judges in
righteous judgment--as the light in every man`'s conscience will testify.

Now, "`whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His Seed remains in him.`"^
footnote:[1 John 3:9; 5:18]
This Seed is life,
and as the creature joins to this Seed (which is the heir of the kingdom and of the
crown immortal) he comes to be made partaker of its virtue and operation.
The Seed is Christ, and by His power He limits the seed of the serpent,
and weakens his strength in the creature.
And as man comes to believe in the Seed`'s strength (unto whom all power is committed),
the covenant with death is broken,
and the agreement that the creature has made with death
comes to be annulled by the arm and power of the Lord.
In this way the creature comes to be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
and the new man comes to live; that is,
the new creature (which is born of God and does not sin) comes
to be framed and fashioned into the image of the Father.
Unto this one, and in this one, is the Father`'s love made manifest,
and he has the assurance in himself.
This babe, who is born from above of the Spirit who is from above,
has been justified by the just God, and has a record of his justification.
"`For there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood;
and these three agree as one.`"^
footnote:[1 John 5:8]
He who is born of that which is pure has the witness of these three in himself,
for they agree in one.
That which one bears witness unto, the other two do the same.
Moreover, "`There are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.`"^
footnote:[1 John 5:7]

So he that is born of the Father, and begotten of the Father in Christ the Seed,
through the Spirit, he, and he alone,
comes to feel the Father`'s love made manifest in him,
and is justified in the sight of the Father.
This one has his assurance and evidence near to him and in him, the seal of the Father,
the seal of the Spirit.
And so when the adversary comes to tempt and to assault,
and would raise up doubts in the mind, the evidence is near,
which puts him out of all doubt that he is in the love of God, and blessed forever.
Happy are all those who have waited for these things, and have felt them,
and are witnesses of them, for flesh and blood has not revealed them.

Now let every man that reads this prove himself, and try himself,
whether he is in the faith or no,
and whether he has the evidence of the Spirit that he is indeed born of it.
Let him try himself whether he knows the birth that
does not sin because the Seed remains in him,
and the evil one does not touch him, being kept by the power of God.
For such as these are kept alive unto Him who has brought them to life,
and has given them to drink of the cup of salvation,
which nourishes up unto eternal life all who continue in the faith.
