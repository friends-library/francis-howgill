What the Spirit of God is which discovers the things of God,
and how it comes to be received.

The Spirit of the Lord, who is one with the Father and the Son, is purity itself,
holiness itself.
It is pure power, pure strength, which does not mix with, or join to,
anything but that which is of its own nature.
It is immeasurable pure substance; it is life issued forth; it is an active living power,
which is everlasting and does not change, keeping its holiness and purity forever.
It is unsearchable, unfathomable, and undeclarable.
All words are too short and too narrow to declare its excellency and glory,
but it makes itself known, opens itself up,
and sheds itself abroad in those who believe and wait upon it.
The Spirit of God is revealed in its own purity, made manifest in its own power,
received in its own light, and felt in its own virtue.
The living Father of life Himself is manifest by it,
and He appears in His power and majesty and excellency
through it to the sons of men--that is,
to the righteous and unrighteous, to the godly and ungodly,
to the upright and to the deceitful,
to the children of darkness and to the children of light.

The Spirit is that which searches the hearts of men, sees through all things,
makes manifest all things,
both the hidden things of God and the secret works of darkness,
reproving for all evil and iniquity.
It is the pure act of the Spirit which convinces every man of sin,
and as the creature comes to join with it, it arises and shines forth more clearly,
making itself known in its power and operation.
Its power comes to be felt as it checks and reproves,
as it judges and condemns all actions that are past, bringing them to remembrance.
And as it is waited upon and hearkened to,
it sheds itself abroad in its own pure brightness, bringing all things to light,
and manifesting the intents of the mind.

Now, as one waits upon the pure appearance of the Spirit, and the mind is still,
quiet, and calm, the creature comes to feel, and sensibly know, his own condition.
He sees that his mind is alive to other things, to other lovers, and not to God,
and so he recognizes himself to be dead to the things of God's kingdom,
and still in the fall and transgression.
Now, that which shows the vain motions and thoughts, and checks them,
this is the operation of the Spirit,
and its purity comes to be felt working in the heart.
And as this work is loved and obeyed, it leads and converts the heart to the Lord,
and draws towards itself, out of unholiness, and out from under the dark power,
bringing all darkness under.
And so the Spirit arises in its strength (as it is believed in and waited upon),
and judges and condemns all evil.
For the Spirit is the discoverer of the mind of the Lord to the sons of men,
and by it the Father makes known His mind to and in the creature,
revealing the things that are eternal in their property and nature.
Only those who have the Spirit, and are brought out of sensuality,
come to discern Him who is invisible,
and know the things that belong to everlasting happiness.
Such things are not seen by the natural eye,
nor are they received by the spirit of the world--for
the world cannot receive the things of God,
or the testimony of those who are in His life.

Now, all that come to receive the Spirit of truth must wait in, and be joined to,
that which is pure.
For the Spirit does not join to the corrupt man, to the sensual heart,
to the vile affections, to those whose eyes are full of adultery.
It does not join to the seed of falsehood, to the corruptible birth,
to that which is born of the flesh, nor to the will of the creature.
Nevertheless, though it will not join to these, yet it is near to man,
even to the natural man.
Its manifestation, or the shining forth of its brightness,
makes all these things manifest to be evil.
And for this purpose the Spirit of God has appeared to the world,
to convince the world of sin.
For while the heart of any man is taken up with sin,
and is joined to that which the light reproves, it cannot receive the Spirit,
nor become a possessor and enjoyer of it.
Instead, the Spirit stands off from such a man at a distance,
manifesting both the worker of iniquity and his works of darkness.
But in as much as a man denies himself,
and joins himself to the manifestation of God's
Spirit (shining forth within him in purity,
and so reproving him) so he receives a measure of the Spirit of holiness,
and feels the power of God in a small measure (though but weakly) working in him
towards the purging out of those things which the Spirit lets him see to be evil.
And so in some measure he feels and learns in himself what to wait upon,
and where to wait,
and in what--even in that which gives everyone a feeling of their own condition within,
and opens their understanding.
