== Section XII.

[.chapter-subtitle--blurb]
A word to the wise men of the world, who are glorying in the sound of words,
and worshipping outward appearances,
who desire to search into the deep things of God by their natural wisdom,
learning, and study.

God is shedding abroad His power and glory,
and making it to flow forth to His little ones,
by which you are all weighed--all your learning, tongues, languages, interpretations,
significations, and wisdom, which are only natural.
For although there are many languages, and each has an interpretation, and signification,
they are all too short to declare the life, the immeasurable being of eternal life.
O you wise teachers, with your rhetoric, philosophy, disputes, and languages,
you cannot know the mind of the Spirit or the Author of eternal salvation.
And not knowing the living eternal Spirit by these things, you invent, study, devise,
form, and frame up things in your carnal minds.
In this way you fill the whole world with your dark and muddy conceptions,
leading men away from the living wisdom of God, which is above, and was before,
your words and languages.

Oh the world has swallowed down your concepts and distinctions,
your devised fables and imagined worship,
and so many have lost all sense of God in themselves to guide them,
and so are further from the true knowledge of God than they
were in the day they came out of their mother`'s womb.
Oh how lamentable to see how many have gone out
of the pure simplicity which is in Christ,
into subtlety and deceit,
and who are now stuffed and filled up with that which must be poured out as water
before they can come to the least measure of God`'s true and saving knowledge.
Oh, a dreadful Day comes upon you as a thief,
for you have taken away the key of knowledge, and given people that which will not open.
You, and those who follow you, will be shut out together as fools,
though you count yourselves wise.
Indeed, your wisdom will perish, and your honor will be laid in the dust.

And you literal professors of Christianity who
have got the Scripture into your heads,
and into your carnal minds to talk of, how you have taken up and exalted visible,
shadowy practices, but neglected the life!
You are making idols of those things which were
but figures and representations in their time.
And you, like the Pharisees, are limiting the Lord.
For if He will not appear unto you according to those things
which you have prescribed and gathered from the written letter,
then you will not receive Him.
For you have heaped up your interpretations in the fleshly part of man,
which has risen up like a mountain within you, high above God`'s pure witness in you,
high above His appearance,
so that you have lost sight of that which could give you the knowledge of the living God,
and make you sensible of His pure presence.
May the Lord open your understanding, that you may see yourselves, and how frothy, vain,
light, and wanton you are,
and how you are one with the world in all things at their very source.
You claim liberty in Christ, and privileges in Him,
even while you are still servants to corruption and many harmful lusts.

Consider, what are all outward appearances, but as a curtain, or veil, or shadow,
compared with Christ, who is God`'s righteousness within.
But you are filled so full of your apprehensions of His righteousness
at a distance that you have forgotten your own condition at home.
For indeed, Christ`'s righteousness will not be a cloak for
your self-righteousness and unrighteousness.
And if Christ is not formed in you, and does not live in you, and act in you,
and work His work in you, you are in self-righteousness.
And all talk of imputation will not save you while you are not in
that nature and faith unto whom His righteousness is imputed.
Are you not weary with blowing to and fro among the earthy hills that you
have formed yourselves? Do you not see that your land has grown barren,
and your possessions dry, and your worship dead,
and that the rains and dews of heaven do not fall on you,
but instead you wither daily as a branch without sap?
What have you found that will last unto eternity? Oh,
is it not rusted and fading already? Is it not cankered and
moth-eaten already? The glory of all earthly things is fading,
and all earthly appearances, though ever so glorious, are all to cease.
There will be no more glory in these things,
for they will all fly away as a shadow when the sun arises.
Your riches are wasting away, but when will you seek after that which endures forever?

I pity you who have had true breathings after God,
but have sat down at ease in that which is not eternal.
Be warned, return home!
Do you rest in a faith that says you will never be cleaned here? That faith is cursed,
it is reprobate, it is more properly called unbelief.
It is not the faith of God`'s elect,
by which they were sanctified and overcame the
wicked one in themselves by the power of Christ.
For Christ is able to save and manifest His ability in all who believe in the light.
Indeed, Christ manifests himself to the creature,
and makes known His power in the creature,
in order to redeem the soul out of death and from under the bondage of corruption,
to serve in the free Spirit of God,
in which the sons are made free from sin and become temples of the Holy Spirit.
Consider how far you are from this,
you who are still temples of uncleanness and habitations of deadly lusts.
For truly, setting up and conforming to a visible,
external practice will not justify you while that which has transgressed the
Life and disobeyed the Light is still the head in you,
and is risen up above what is pure.
You must come to the Rock before you will know anything that will endure,
or anything to build upon--which Rock is Christ, who abides forever.
But you have gone out from that which could give you the knowledge of God in yourselves,
that is, the Light of His Spirit, which shines in your hearts,
making manifest the intentions of the heart and the motions unto evil.

The time of restoration is come, and many are restored again into God`'s covenant.
Many have been delivered out of the jaws of death,
and feel Him who is the healer of breaches to be the restorer of desolate places.
But all must come to see the place made desolate wherein the wild nature lodges,
before they come to have a share in the restoration.
Come then, come down off the barren mountains where you are feeding.
Come unto Christ the Life of men, who has enlightened you,
so that you may feel His mind in yourselves.
Otherwise you will continue to err for lack of knowledge,
and perish for lack of understanding, and so lay down your head in sorrow.
